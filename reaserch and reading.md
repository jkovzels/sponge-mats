# White and green roofs

> Unlike white roofs, green roofs do not offset climate change. White roofs are more reflective than green roofs, reflecting roughly three times more sunlight back into the atmosphere and therefore absorbing less sunlight at earth’s surface. By absorbing less sunlight than either green or black roofs, white roofs offset a portion of the warming effect from greenhouse gas emissions.

> “Both white and green roofs do a good job at cooling the building and cooling the air in the city, but white roofs are three times more effective at countering climate change than green roofs,” said Rosenfeld.

> Without due diligence, it’s no surprise that cool roofs have begun to experience problems. A study done at Stanford University shows that white roofs may actually increase, not decrease, the earth’s temperature. White roof membranes have high reflectivity that directs heat upward into the atmosphere and then mixes with black and brown soot particles, which are thought to contribute to global warming.

>Starkweather Roofing installed data loggers on the new white roof of the Nationwide Scottsdale Insurance Company and on the traditional roof of the building next door in order to confirm the energy efficiency of white versus non-white roofs.
