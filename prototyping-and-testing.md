# Prototyping and testing plan

Short term goals:
1. Select and source cost-efficient adhesive and process to bind the pieces of raw materials into the mesh to form core layer.
2.	Develop process to form external isolating layer.
3.	Deploy first prototype and measurement setup. The goal of this step is to retrofit part of the roof of selected building with Sponge mats and the array of temperature sensors on the mat, beneath the mat, on the roof from inside etc. to measure the effect.
4.	Find 2 identical buildings (garage, hangar, warehouse) to deploy mats on one of them to collect data on the changes in air-conditioning and air temperatures in the working areas.


## Prototype 1
Small scale test aimed to collect temparature data, estimate time and material costs to produce and deploy the mats.

For this test the plan is to build 5x5 meter and 5-8 thick mat and deploy on the roof of a building together with temperature sensors. In addition to the mat 'write roof' and 'black roof' control areas should be set on the sam roof. 'White roof' control areas is a portion of the roof painted white using same paint as the mat. 'Black roof' is unmodified area of the roof.

### Building requirements:
Roof size should be at least 6 by 12 meter. Flat with close to 0 degree slope. Ideally no other buildings should cast shadow on the test area. Access to the ceiling to deploy temperature ceiling temperature sensors is required.

### Materials and equipment:
#. Nike Grind. Composition and amount TBD
#. Portable concrete mixer.
#. Adhesive for core layer.
#. Non-wowen fabric and liquid rubber or similar elastomer to form external waterproof layer.
#. White reflective paint for mat and white roof control area.
#. Timber for formwork.
#. Set of tools.

## Prototype 2

Large scale test aimed to collect real impact on energy efficiency and working condiotions of the building. Test should be conducted using 2 identical buildings, one to retrofit, another for control.
