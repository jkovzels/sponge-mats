Water absorbing mats to keep rainwater in the city for better heat, flood and energy management.


We all experienced how cities can be scoarching hot, becoming much warmer then surronding rural areas. This phenomenon occures in part due to unnnatural way how cities manage rainwater.

In the nature, rainwater is absorbed by soil and vegitation, and when tepmerature rises, water evaporates producing natural cooling effect.

Unlike natural environments, rainwater is historically dumped into pipes and drainage system breaking natural cycle and cooling.

Sponge mats is a viable, maintanance free solution, resrotes natural processes by absorbing rainwater and allowing it to evaporate when temperature raises.

Sponge mats are produced on 99% pecent on recycled Nike Grind materials.
Sponge mats leverages inherent properties on Nike Grind materials to absorb and keep water and requires close to zero energy consumption to build.
