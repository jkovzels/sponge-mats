Water absorbing mats to keep rainwater in the city for better heat, flood and energy management.


We all experienced how cities can be scoarching hot, becoming much warmer then surronding rural areas. [This phenomenon occures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island) in part due to unnnatural way how cities manage rainwater.

In the nature, rainwater is absorbed by soil and vegitation, and when tepmerature rises, water evaporates producing natural cooling effect.

Unlike in natural environments, rainwater in the cities is historically dumped into pipes and drainage system breaking natural cycle and cooling.

Sponge mats are aimed to resrote natural processes by absorbing rainwater and allowing it to evaporate when temperature raises.

Sponge mats is a viable alternative to reflective white roofs and green roofs.

White roofs are [found to be effective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652?via%3Dihub) in reflecting sunlight and cool down the surface of the roof. Sponge mats when painted with reflective white coating provide the same benefits, and besides that, leverage [evaporative cooling effect](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Evaporative_cooling).  

Green roofs, roofs with soil and vegetation provides benefits of natural cooling but intails high intallation and maitanance cost and can be unefficient in water deprived regions. 

Sponge mats leverage benefits of both white and green roofs and is cost-efficient and low-maitanance solution.  


Sponge mats are produced on 99% pecent on recycled Nike Grind materials.
Sponge mats leverages inherent properties on Nike Grind materials to absorb and keep water and requires close to zero energy consumption to build.

# Manufacturing technology
Core componenent of mat is the mesh of variety of Nike Grind materils. The main purpose of the mesh is to retain the rainwater and protects it from wind and direct sunligt (to slow down the drying out). Mix of injection scraps, flashing and textile scraps gives exacply the properties reqiered without much energy or materil heavy processing. 

External waterproof isolating layer of the mat is likely will be produces out of non-woven fabric and rubber/silicon/elastomer and foil. The same materials used in construction to waterproof the roofs. Isolation layer can be omited if the foor is already waterproofed and dtainage system can be altered to allow 6-8 cm of water to retain of the roof at anytime.




# Prtotyping and testing

We already had an opportunity to work with and build Protorype 0 out of Nike Grind materials during the [workshop in Berlin](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/reuse-remake-recycle-a-chat-with-leaders-in-circular-economy-tickets-44645786750#). This prototyping phase helped us better properties of maerials and adjust the list of materils we are planning to use.

Next R&D steps include: 
1. Find cost-efficient adhesive and process to bind the pieces of raw materials into the mesh to form core layer.
2. Develop process to form exernal isolating layer
3. Deploy fitst prototype and measurement setup. The goal of this step is to retrofit part of the roof of selected building with Sponge mats and the array of temperature sensors on the mat, beneth the mat, on the roof from inside etc to measure the the effect.
4. Find 2 identical buildings (garage, hangar, warehouse) to deploy mats on one of them to collect data on the changes in airconditioning and air temperatures in the working areas.
