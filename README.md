# Sponge mats
### Water absorbing mats to keep rainwater in the city for better heat, flood and energy management.

Sponge City Mats is a way to retrofit existing rooftops to facilitate natural evaporative cooling effect. Sponge City Mats absorb and keep rainwater imitating natural environment where water is soaked up by soil and vegetation.

We all experienced how cities can be scorching hot at summer, becoming much warmer then surrounding rural areas. [This phenomenon occurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island) in part due to unnatural way how cities manage rainwater.

In the nature, rainwater is absorbed by soil and vegetation, and when temperature rises, water evaporates producing natural cooling effect.

Unlike in natural environments, rainwater in the cities is historically dumped into pipes and drainage system breaking natural cycle and cooling.

Sponge mats are aimed to restore natural processes by absorbing rainwater and allowing it to evaporate when temperature raises.

Sponge mats is a viable alternative to reflective white roofs and green roofs.

White roofs are [found to be effective](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813007652?via%3Dihub) in reflecting sunlight and cool down the surface of the roof. Sponge mats when painted with reflective white coating provide the same benefits, and besides that, leverage [evaporative cooling effect](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Evaporative_cooling).  

Green roofs, roofs with soil and vegetation provides benefits of natural cooling but entails high installation and maintenance cost and can be inefficient in water deprived regions. 

Sponge mats leverage benefits of both white and green roofs and is cost-efficient and low-maintenance solution.  


Sponge mats are produced on 99% percent on recycled Nike Grind materials.
Sponge mats leverages inherent properties on Nike Grind materials to absorb and keep water and requires close to zero energy consumption to build.


# Manufacturing technology
Core componenent of mat is the mesh of variety of Nike Grind materils. The main purpose of the mesh is to retain the rainwater and protects it from wind and direct sunligt (to slow down the drying out). Mix of injection scraps, flashing and textile scraps gives exacply the properties reqiered without much energy or materil heavy processing. 

External waterproof isolating layer of the mat is likely will be produces out of non-woven fabric and rubber/silicon/elastomer and foil. The same materials used in construction to waterproof the roofs. Isolation layer can be omited if the foor is already waterproofed and dtainage system can be altered to allow 6-8 cm of water to retain of the roof at anytime.


# Prototyping and testing

We already had an opportunity to work with and build Prototype 0 out of Nike Grind materials during the [workshop in Berlin](https://www.eventbrite.de/e/reuse-remake-recycle-a-chat-with-leaders-in-circular-economy-tickets-44645786750#). This prototyping phase helped us better properties of materials and adjust the list of materials we are planning to use.
Next R&D steps include:
1.	Find and source cost-efficient adhesive and process to bind the pieces of raw materials into the mesh to form core layer.
2.	Develop process to form external isolating layer.
3.	Deploy first prototype and measurement setup. The goal of this step is to retrofit part of the roof of selected building with Sponge mats and the array of temperature sensors on the mat, beneath the mat, on the roof from inside etc. to measure the effect.
4.	Find 2 identical buildings (garage, hangar, warehouse) to deploy mats on one of them to collect data on the changes in air-conditioning and air temperatures in the working areas.

# Customer base
### Primary application

1. Factories, warehouses, or any number businesses operating from flat roof buildings and spending money on air conditioning of premises.
2. Residential communities making building more energy efficient and improving living conditions.
3. [Walkable modification](#walkable-surfaces) can be used in public spaces and on playgrounds.

### Alternative applications
1. Sealed in fabric can be used to alter soil mechanics in landscaping and agriculture
2. Office workers when used as acoustic panels 

# Alternative applications

# Additinal benefits
Redusing the load on drainage system


## Accoustic panels and ceilings

## Hyrdoponic layer for gardening and agronomy.

## Walkable surfaces


# Sales and marketing

Berlin is one of the best possible places to start and scale business like Sponge mats.

Germans are ecologically conscious and willing to make modest sacrifices in the name of energy independence and climate protection. Germany is one of the world leaders in recycling. 

Electricity prices and [energy efficiency requirements](
http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/guest-blogs/german-building-codes-keep-ratcheting) for new and existing building push building owners operators to seek for new ways to leave smaller energy footprint.

Berlin has established social entrepreneurship networks and substantial amount of socially responsible and environmentally conscious companies. We will seek partnerships with local businesses through governmental organizations and social impact communities.

We will also reach and work together with city architects to improve the design and incorporate the mats into upcoming city improvement projects.

At the same time starting in Germany poses the challenge to navigate German fire safety and constructions regulations with can be cumbersome and time consuming. To mitigate this challenge, we will start dialog with city architects and authorities at the early stage of the project development.
